DSA_MC provides a Monte-Carlo implementation to produce pseudo-data from the expressions for the DSA in diffractive dijet production studied in [https://inspirehep.net/literature/2843086](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2843086). 

To run the code: 
```
python dsa_mc.py <sample size> <output file> <root s (GeV)> 
```
